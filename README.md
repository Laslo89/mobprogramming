# Mob Programming Session - meme rating

Hello and welcome to our mob programming session. Lets build something cool together!

## Goal

Create a small Web Application that lets you rate your favorite memes. As good source for memes we will use the api of imageflip.com.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Retrieve the top 100 Meme Templates from imgflip.com.

    1.1 (Bonus / Stretch goal) Store the meme data locally so you dont have to pull the memes every time you reload or visit the app.

2. Compare Mode - Create a view where you can choose between two memes which one is funnier

3. You Favorites - Create a view where you can look at your favourite Memes (the funnier ones)
